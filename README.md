# Clothify-System
This is my graduation project as a front end engineer intern in Banque Misr (Digital Factory). This project was developed by one backend and three front end developers (web, android, and iOS). I was responsible for the web front end using Angular and Bootstrap.

## Project Description
Clothify-System is an online shopping website that allows users to browse, search, and purchase products. The website features a user-friendly interface, and an administration page that enables the management of products. The website also follows the color scheme and UI/UX principles of the other apps in the project. The project was developed using software engineering and SOLID principles. As a team, we followed the agile methodology and we got the best project in this internship in front end and one of the top three projects in the internship as a full project including backend and front end apps.

## Project Features
The website has the following features:

- Login screen: A user can login with email and password.
- Registration screen: New users can register using name, email and password.
- Home screen: The home screen has a bottom bar to switch between three screens:
  - Products: List of available products. A user can filter, sort, and search for products by name, category, price, etc. A user can also view the details of a product and add it to the shopping cart.
  - Shopping cart: List of selected products to be bought. A user can edit the quantity, remove items, or proceed to checkout.
  - User profile: Display info of the user (name, email and password). A user can also edit their info or log out.
- Administration page: A page for managing products. Only authorized users can access this page. A user can add, edit, or delete products.

## Project Setup

To install and run the project locally, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub.
2. Install Node.js and npm on your machine.
3. Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `ng serve` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` to view the website.

## Project Testing
To test the project and ensure its quality, I used Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor as testing tools and frameworks. You can run the following commands to execute the tests and view the results:

- `ng test` to run unit tests with Karma.
- `ng e2e` to run end-to-end tests with Protractor.


## Project Honors
This project was honored by Banque Misr (Digital Factory) as the best front end project and the full project was one of the top three projects in the internship. Here are some photos of the honoring ceremony:
